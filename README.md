# PacMan Neural Network
## Purpose: To develop a neural network that learns to navigate and succeed in a PacMan inspired game.

### Background:
### I build this project to further my experience with Python, but more specifically PyTorch and reinforcement learning. I had an idea to create a real-estate
### machine learning program, but no experience with machine learning, so this project's ***real*** purpose was as a hands-on and application based teaching tool for myself.
### This project uses a Q-Learning algorithmn to develop it's decision making, and it is rewarded and punished for moves that I deemed productive or counter productive.
